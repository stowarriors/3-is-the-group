Source Codes

This Snakes and Ladders project is created using the 5.13 Qt version. 

Snakes and Ladders is a game that originated in india with the same basic principles where the player rolls the die,
the only difference is the form of the game board where it is on a cloth and it represent a building to be cleared to the top.

Our game has the same principles just like the regular Snakes and Ladders game but "Guified" where additional features like
login forms and scoring system had been added.

So using our program to play the game involves the process of:

1. Opening the program will prompt the user to a login window where you will have to create your own account using the create button. The number of the verified user is not limited to one so you can create many accounts as you want. After creating an account, it is then used to login by pressing the login button.

2. After which the user is verified, the login window will close and will open the mainwindow where the games is located. Starting off you will see an input bar where you can enter the player 1 and player 2 names. After you entered the names, only then the Start Game Button will be enabled because it is initially greyed out. 

3. Pressing the Start Game will draw the two players in the game board below which will then enable the Die Roll button.

4. After the player is drawn, you can now officially play the game. Player1 is the red piece and the Player2 is the blue piece. Pressing the Die button will roll you a turn randomly from a range of 1-6 which is then in return will make your chosen piece move that corresponding turn.

5. The Snakes and Ladders part is represented by lines where the red lines is the snake and the white lines is the ladder.

6. Reaching the last tile will declare that player the winner and the game will record the number of turns that player did before winning.

7. The player will then be able to view scores by pressing the score button which will display the rankings of the players that played the game. The list will be displayed in a descending order in which the lower the score the better.

8. Additional functions included are the search button and the clear button where the search function will display the score of the inputted name and the clear button will clear all the saved scores and players of the game.
